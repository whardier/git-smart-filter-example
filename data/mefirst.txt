This is a text file that has the next line set to an odd little timestamp thingeroozie.

This timestamp right here ( TIMESTAMP ) is pretty neat. //TIMESTAMPIFY:EPOCH:TIMESTAMP:

It should be a comment char followed by TIMESTAMPIFY followed by a colon followed by a function name EPOCH and then the variable to substitute and another colon as a placemark to reverse the transformation.

Really. It should.

Really. Honest. Yup...
